```
The basics ...
- after 1 rainbow of effort
- developers have learned about unit tests
- a unit testing framework has been added
- a couple of unit tests have been written
  - Unit tests to consider
  - If birds hit unicorn gameplay should halt
  - If obstacles hit unicorn gameplay should halt
- the unit tests that were written don't even begin to cover the large function that does most of the work
- design flaws are identified; take care of that now? Or ...

Notes:
- codebase has a large monolithic function that performs a LOT of things
- a couple of unit tests cover very little functionality within that function
- adding test framework from scratch takes time, learning new testing paradigms take time
- 1 rainbow of effort didn't get you much benefit, but does make progress toward needed tests

Code that should go in here:
- 1 or two unit tests against the draw function in the index.js file
- framework is mocha/chai

Choices:
- refactor the application, given the design flaw that has been identified
  - break down the one function into many and begin to have clearer coverage
- keep going down unit tests path
  - leave the large function and just werite a bunch more unit tests for it
```
