Once upon a time a funny story was written for Starwest and YOU were put in charge. 

Will you survive or will you die of dysentery?
```

```
The basics:  
- This codebase begins with an existing app and existing set of tests
- Tests should represent the ice cream cone model
  - Highest number of acceptance tests
    - At first, these should be unmaintainable Selenium crap
  - Some number of API tests
  - very few unit tests
- "legacy" application, with effort put toward testing, but somewhat misguided

- new test lead comes in and should choose where to focus attention first
- for the first 1 rainbow worth of effort, which direction do you choose?
```

```
You are standing in an open field west of a white house. The house is still under construction, and appears to be coming along... You talk to one person working on the house, and he tells you that nobody has come to do any inspections yet, but as far as the workers can tell, everything is as it should be.

Around the back of the house you see a long line of people, all of them holding little white envelopes. They seem very eager to help with the house.

There are two mailboxes here.

The first mailbox is simply labeled "<API/Unit Tests Fun Word>".

The second is mysteriously labeled "<Switching to better acceptance test framework>".

Both are overflowing.

Choose which box to open.
```

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "<API/Unit Tests Fun Word>": [turn to page 23](../page-23/README.md)

If you choose to spend one rainbow of effort on "<Switching to better acceptance test framework>": [turn to page 42](../page-42/README.md)
