```
You dodge to the left and fall into a jungle of acceptance tests...
```

```
The basics ...
- putting in the framework takes time
- but ... 1 or 2 acceptance test later, there is some more clarity around the state of the application from a higher-level perspective (I mean, non-coders can see the test run and pass and see their value)
- if all of those tests pass, though, what is the benefit?
  - domain language
  - all on the same page
  - act as regression
  - owners can see state and value
  - tests are in code
  - faster feedback loops
 
Test Cases that should be in this branch (cucumber/selenium tests):
- 

Notes on choices:
- Yay! We see value in shared high level tests and our test strategy is sound; let's leave these in place at a high level and focus some more on lower level tests
- We're on a roll! Let's add a bunch more tests! Let's apply this to all levels of tests, including unit tests!
