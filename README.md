```
While writing more acceptance tests you uncover some defects...

The end.
```

```
The basics:
- Should be something in here about defects uncovered being hard to track down and identify in the large monolithic function
- acceptance tests are coming along well and testers are getting good at writing them
- unit tests are now also added (these are the same unit tests that we add in the original page 23 code)

Test Cases:
- Lots of acceptance tests
- also adding unit tests

Defect(s) uncovered:
- identify that the words about Turn should have said "Turn: User"
